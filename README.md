# QA Compass 🧭

QA Compass is an open-source, community-driven guide that helps QA professionals
navigate learning paths with clarity and trust.

This is not another course platform.
This is a compass — showing *what to learn, when, and why*.

## Why QA Compass exists

QA learning is broken because:
- There is too much content and no clear direction
- Tutorials conflict with each other
- AI tools sound confident but are often wrong
- Beginners don’t know what to trust

QA Compass solves this by curating **trusted learning paths**,
validated by real QA professionals.

## What you’ll find here

- Clear QA learning paths (Beginner → Advanced)
- Carefully curated resources (videos, blogs, docs)
- Honest notes on *why* a resource is recommended
- Signals when content may be outdated

## What you won’t find here

- Paid courses
- Hype-driven recommendations
- AI-generated guesses without sources

## How to contribute

QA Compass grows with the community.

- Suggest resources via PR
- Report outdated content via Issues
- Improve learning paths via Discussions

## Philosophy

Clarity over noise.  
Trust over hype.  
Community over algorithms.
